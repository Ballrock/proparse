Provides the Bubble Declarations refactoring.
</p>
<p>
The Bubble Declarations refactoring is intended as an intermediate
step to further refactorings. It bubbles up SHARED declarations
to the top of the topmost file in the compile unit. It bubbles
up the non-shared definitions so that they are grouped together
following the SHARED declarations.
